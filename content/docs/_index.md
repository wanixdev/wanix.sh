## Install

The Wanix CLI is available for download from the [latest release](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/releases/latest) or you can run this installer:

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tractordev/wanix/main/install.sh)"
```

Alternatively you can install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew tap progrium/homebrew-taps
brew install wanix
```

## Usage
```
wanix [command]

Available Commands:
dev              start wanix dev server
bootfiles        write out wanix boot files
deploy           deploy Wanix static site to GitHub Pages

Flags:
  -v    show version

Use "wanix [command] -help" for more information about a command.
```

### wanix dev

This runs a local dev server you can access in the browser. At the moment, it needs to
be run in a checkout of this repository and will make it available from within the environment at `/sys/dev`.

### wanix bootfiles

This will write out the 3 files necessary to manually set up a page to load Wanix. To boot Wanix on a page just include these lines:

```html
<script src="./wanix-bootloader.js"></script>
<script>bootWanix()</script>
```

### wanix deploy

This will set up a static site on a domain you provide using GitHub Pages. It will create a repository and set everything up for you. You can optionally have it set up authentication with the `--enable-auth` flag. This will configure [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for you to be able to login with GitHub. When logged in, Wanix will mount the GitHub repository for the site itself at `/repo`, which you can use to modify the site from itself using Wanix. 

## Using the Wanix environment

Here are a few things you can do in the environment in this early state:

### See available built-in commands

A number of common Unix command are available in the shell, which you can see by running `help`. Currently this does not list user or system commands found in `/cmd` or `/sys/cmd`, but you can list those using `ls`. Notable system commands include `build` and `micro`.

### Work with the filesystem

Use common Unix commands (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, ...) to navigate around the filesystem. The root filesystem is [indexedfs](internal/indexedfs), which stores files in IndexedDB. However, by implementing the [filesystem API](https://github.com/tractordev/toolkit-go/tree/main/engine/fs) you can create new filesystems to mount. For example, `/sys/dev` is mounted when run with the dev server using [httpfs](internal/httpfs) to expose the project repository from the host. 

The Wanix filesystem layout is different than Unix/Linux, so here are some relevant paths used by Wanix:

 * `/app` - For user applications.
 * `/cmd` - For user commands.
 * `/sys` - For Wanix system paths:
   * `/sys/app` - For system applications.
   * `/sys/cmd` - For system commands.
   * `/sys/bin` - Cache for wasm binaries.
   * `/sys/tmp` - For temporary files, held in-memory.
   * `/sys/dev` - Read-only mount of project repo from host dev server.

### Install Hugo

We have a build of Hugo available that works in Wanix you can install with:

```sh
cd /cmd
get https://dl.wanix.sh/misc/hugo.wasm
hugo -h
```

### Create a shell script command

You can create commands by putting them in the `/cmd` directory. Commands can be shell scripts, wasm binaries, or buildable source directories. Shell scripts ending in `.sh` can contain commands that would run on the shell. For example, you can use `micro` to create a script to `echo` "Hello world":

```
micro /cmd/hello.sh
```

Add this line to the newly created file in micro:

```
echo Hello world
```

Use `ctrl-s` to save and `ctrl-q` to quit. Now you can run `hello` in the shell.

### Create a command from source directory

You can use `build` to compile a wasm binary from any directory containing a Go main package, then move or copy it into `/cmd`. However, you can also just create a directory in `/cmd` with Go source and use it like a command. Wanix will compile and run it for you. Make a new directory under `/cmd` with `mkdir`:

```
mkdir /cmd/gohello
```

Use `micro` to create and edit a `main.go` file:

```
micro /cmd/gohello/main.go
```

Then write a small Go program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello world from Go")
}

```

Use `ctrl-s` then `ctrl-q` to save and quit. Now if you run `gohello`, the program will be compiled and run. If you run it again, it will run the cached binary. If you modify the source and run the command again, it *should* recompile and use an updated binary, but there is currently [an issue](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/issues/66) waiting for you to implement this.

### Create a web application

Wanix applications are simply web applications under `/app`. If you create a directory like `/app/webapp` with an `index.html`, you can then open the application with `open webapp`.

This will load `/app/webapp/index.html` into a full page iframe. You can get back to and toggle the console in visor mode with Control + the `~` key. Changes made to any file in `/app/webapp` will cause the frame to reload. 

Any TypeScript source files ending in `.ts` will be converted to JavaScript when loaded in this frame. The same for any files using JSX ending in `.jsx` or `.tsx`.

### Editing the shell in Wanix

Since source commands are compiled when launched, they are also re-compiled after being edited. The shell is one example of this. If you edit the shell source under `/sys/cmd/shell`, such as the banner found in `main.go`, reloading the page will cause the shell to be re-compiled with the new source.

### Build a 3rd party Go program for Wanix

Wanix will eventually [support any WASI program](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/issues/67), but for now it runs Go programs compiled with `GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm`. If it compiles without a problem, it should be able to run in Wanix. However, larger programs may have dependencies that won't build for this target without some modification. You can see the changes we made to `micro` under [external/micro](external/micro), but it will really be different for every project. For now, here is an example program compiled outside Wanix brought in via the `/sys/dev` mount (running locally).

We use the `local` directory in checkouts of this repo for local changes not intended to be contributed. This is a good place to build a program that will be easy to copy into Wanix. For example, you can create `./local/example` with a `main.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello world from a Go program made outside Wanix")
}

```

Build it with js/wasm target, *outside* Wanix:

```
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o example.wasm
```

Now from *inside* Wanix, you can copy the resulting file into `/cmd` from `/sys/dev`:

```
cp /sys/dev/local/example/example.wasm /cmd/example.wasm
```

You should now be able to run `example`.

## Contributing

We are currently developing a roadmap to convey the direction we're exploring with Wanix, but this is an open and modular project that you can take and experiment with for your own purposes. If you're interested in how it works, take a look at our quick [overview](doc/overview.md) and then check out the source. Most of Wanix exists in the `kernel` directory, which is a good place to start. The `build` and `shell` directories are where you'll find the source for those two components.

Take a look at our [issues](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/issues) to see how you can help out. You can also ask questions and participate in [discussions](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/discussions), however right now most discussion takes place in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nbrwNXVvVa).
